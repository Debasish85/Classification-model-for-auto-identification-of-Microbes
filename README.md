### Classification-model-for-auto-identification-of-Microbes

### Problem Statement

Bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a significant health risk. Hence, rapid identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become paramount in saving lives and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. In patients with septic shock from bacterial infections, identification of antibiotic-resistance genes is essential because the mortality rate increases 7.6% per hour of delay in administering correct antibiotics. Unfortunately, it takes more than 24 h to grow up the bacteria recovered from the blood of an infected patient, identify the species, and then determine to which antibiotics the organism is resistant, leading to a very high mortality rate for such infections.Hence, this project is aiming to employ machine learning to rapidly classify microbes using measurements of cellular features generated from microscopic imagery.

### Methods used

- Box-cox Transformation.
- Pearson Ranking.
- ANOVA f-test.
- Scikit learn.
- SMOTE.
- Random Forest.
- Decision Tree.

### Assumptions

- The recorded data is representative of the larger environment.
- Bias in the dataset, as there are ways in which bias could be inadvertently introduced into the data.
- The media could provide optimum condition for growth of the micro-organism without any competetion for survival.
